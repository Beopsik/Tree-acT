# Tree-acT

Build your react project with TREE!

## How to build ?

### Prerequisites

- VSCode : Basically this is VSCode extension, for this reason you need VSCode to run this code.
- Node.js : This is extension of VSCode which is built with electron powered by node, for this reason you need Node.js to build this extension.
- npm & npx : npx is the utility of npm so you need npm, and our extension uses [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) internally so you need npx too.
- yarn : You need yarn as package manager because we are using [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) currently.
